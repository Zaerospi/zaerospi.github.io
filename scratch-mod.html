        <h1>Set list block</h1>
        <!-- <p>This mod adds two new blocks to the block palatte, and both are capable of setting lists. One block sets one list to another by selecting them from dropdown menus. The other block sets a list to a string, by selecting a list in a dropdown and putting a formatted string into the other input. Each word in the string becomes an element, or if there is only one word, each character becomes an element.<br>This mod was made to provide an easily accessible hands on demo for the set list to string block. I have a forum topic on <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu">scratch.mit.edu</a> for that block <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/discuss/topic/114324/">here</a>. The topic is closed to prevent necroposts because the topic is linked to from here and my signature.</p> -->
        <p><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/discuss/topic/114324/">Suggestion thread</a><br>A block to set a list to a string. Read the suggestion thread to see just how useful this block could be. You select a list from a dropdown menu, and use a string to set the contents of the list. If the string has spaces in it("item whatever 342"), then the string is separated by spaces, and each "word" becomes an item(["item", "whatever", "342]). If there are no spaces in the string, then each character becomes an item("abc" -> ["a", "b", "c"]).</br> There is also an extra block in this little mod that has two list dropdowns to set the contents of one list to a copy of another's.</p>
