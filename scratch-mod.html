    <p>This page is where you can find my one and only Scratch mod. If I make more mods or extensions, this page will become a collection of my mods. Here you can read about the mods, open the modded editor, and download the modified source.</p>

        <h1>Set list block</h1>
        <p>This mod adds two new blocks to the block palatte, and both are capable of setting lists. One block sets one list to another by selecting them from dropdown menus. The other block sets a list to a string, by selecting a list in a dropdown and putting a formatted string into the other input. Each word in the string becomes an element, or if there is only one word, each character becomes an element.<br>This mod was made for an easily accessible hands on demo for the set list to string block. I have a forum topic on <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu">scratch.mit.edu for that block <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/discuss/topic/114324/">here</a>. The topic is closed to prevent necroposts because the topic is linked to from here and my signature.</p>
