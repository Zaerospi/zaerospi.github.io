        <h1>Set list block</h1>
        <p>This mod adds two new blocks to the block palatte, and both are capable of setting lists. One block sets one list to another by selecting them from dropdown menus. The other block sets a list to a string, by selecting a list in a dropdown and putting a formatted string into the other input. The elements of the list are separated by spaces in the string.<br>I also have a suggestion forum topic on <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/">scratch.mit.edu</a> to get one on these blocks implemented <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/discuss/topic/114324/">here.</a></p>
